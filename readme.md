## Prayer

- Missions/World
		
		1)	Pray that David and Susan could attend their son Ike’s wedding: David and Susan are based in a country in Asia near China and have been training Chinese Christians to engage in cross-cultural missions. Currently they are still under lockdown. They have airplane tickets to attend their son Ike’s wedding in the US, which is scheduled for July 11, but the airport is still closed. Pray that God might graciously open the door for them to fly to the US and be part of the wedding.
		
		2)	Pray for Zhang Mingzhang and his wife Xiuhui ministering in rural Taiwan: FICCC has recently begun supporting Zhang Mingzhang and his wife Xiuhui, who are former members of our church now doing full-time ministry in rural Taiwan, which is a difficult mission field. Pray that God continues to give them favor in the village where they minister and doors of opportunity to share the gospel. Pray especially that the Lord would use the tutoring school they have started to turn the hearts of the students to Christ.
		
		3)	Reopening after the lockdown:  Pray for wisdom for government leaders in deciding when to allow citizens to return to their work and other activities.  Pray that their decisions will result in the economy being restored as soon as possible while a minimum number of people getting sick.  Pray that citizens will be wise in their practices to help minimize health problems.  Pray also for wisdom for our church leaders as they consider different factors to decide when to reopen our church's worship services and other ministries.  Pray that they will set up procedures so that people can worship and fellowship with each other while keeping physically safe. Pray for God's continued guidance from our leaders as Tompkins County entered Phase 3 reopening on Friday June 12.

Praise - Seminary Extension Class on Bible Ethics: Praise the Lord for a good week of seminary extension class on “Bible Ethics”. 38 brothers and sisters (12 from our church) attended the class and were greatly blessed by the edifying teaching of Dr. Peter Chow. Pray that all will complete the assignments and get the course credit.

		2.	Fellowship Leader training: There will be a four-week fellowship leader training starting on this coming Sunday (6/21), between 9:15 am to 10:45 am.

		3.	New Fellowship Leaders: Praise the Lord that in the past few weeks several members have agreed to take on leadership role and responsibility. Kairui Sun is the new general coordinator of  Basil; Dong Wang and  Miao Huang  are  the new  coordinators of CTBF Jiahe Chen is the new general coordinator of CCCF. Let us support them with prayers.
		
		4.	Personal Relationship with God: It’s inevitable that everyone will experience some struggles in life, especially in a very stressful environment. Sometimes there is no quick solution or simple fix.  What matters the most is that we stay close to God and ask Him to help us maintain healthy relationship with Him and with people around us.  Let us pray for ourselves and for people who are facing struggles.
		
		5.	Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
