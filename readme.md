## Prayer
	
- Missions/World
		
		1) Pray for Stuart and Peggy as they are back in the US: Stuart and Peggy have been back in the US since December and are staying with their daughter in Arizona. Pray that God will open a way for Stuart to get treatment for severe osteoporosis, which was recently diagnosed. Pray as well that God would make it possible for them to stay in touch with friends and colleagues far away without running into major technical obstacles.
	
		2) Pray for Derrick and Esther and their family, who are not back in the US: Due to Thailand decision to declare a state of emergency over the corona virus and the need to avoid being in Thailand with expired visas and unable to leave, Derrick and Esther made a quick decision to travel back to the US with their kids, where they are currently half way through their 14 day quarantine in California. Pray that God will help them to use this time well, to finish up their current Thai language courses online, finish their kids homeschooling, and reconnect with their supporting churches in the US.
		
		3) Pray for FICCC’s Mission Committee as it meets in April: The Mission Committee at FICCC will be holding it twice-annual meeting in April. Pray for God to lead members of the committee as they seeks God’s will for how FICCC should support God’s work around the world. Especially ask that the Lord grants wisdom to discern which needs are priority and which can be left to later, so that our mission funds will yield maximum fruit and bring glory to God.
		
		4) Pray for Lu Tsun-En as he works on his Ph.D. dissertation in New Testament theology: Tsun-En works for Ambassadors for Christ (our church supports his ministry) and is also finishing a Ph.D. in New Testament theology at Westminster Theological Seminary. Let’s pray that God gives him great wisdom and discipline so that he can finish writing his thesis soon. Let’s also ask the Lord to provide for all of his financial needs.
		
		5) Coronavirus Pandemic:  The coronavirus pandemic may be the biggest worldwide crisis of our generation.  In our reaction to this crisis, may we follow the Lord's guidance to pray, "Thine kingdom come, they will be done on earth as it is in heaven," and "Not my will, but Your's be done."  May we pray that God will bring good out of the suffering and that revival will break out as people consider their mortality.  In Psalm 41:1, King David writes, "Blessed are those who have regard for the weak; the Lord delivers them in times of trouble."  May the crisis motivate those who are blessed with strength to help the weak. Pray for researchers to find cures for disease, government leaders to make wise decisions to save lives and jobs, educators to help their students learn, the wealthy to be generous to the poor, and spiritual leaders to counsel the depressed and lead them to the Lord.

- Church

		1. Pray for the Major Events in April.
		a. Chinese Congregation Fasting & Prayer Retreat on 4/4: Continue to pray for our church’s Fasting and Prayer Retreat which will be held on 4/4. Pray that many brothers and sisters will be able to block out the time to attend this fasting and prayer retreat, and be richly blessed revived by the Spirit of God.
		b. Good Friday Special Service: Our bilingual Good Friday service will be on April 10 from 5:30-7:00 pm.  Pray that the Holy Spirit leads Pastor Tang as he plans for the service and prepares his sermon.  Pray that the congregation will truly worship Jesus for the great sacrifice that He has made for us.
		c. Easter Sunday: People tend to be more likely to attend Easter worship services than at other times of the year.  Pray for non-Christians to invite to listen to the English and Chinese Easter services.  Pray that they will believe the message of hope that the resurrection brings.
		d. 4/22 Bible Read-a-thon Promotion and Sign Up: The current season of Bible Read-a-thon will come to an end on April 30.  Pray that many will be able to finish reading all the chapters before the deadline.  Promotion and sign up for the next season (May 1 – October 31) will take place in both services on April 22. Pray that many people, including some new people, will join our Bible Read-a-thon.
		e. 4/26 Church Annual Meeting: We will have a special combined service and annual meeting on 4/26. Please pray for the preparation for the annual meeting which involves collecting, compiling and editing annual reports; drafting and sending e-mail meeting notice to members; and preparing ballots. Pray also for the preparation of the combined worship service. Pray for wisdom for members who are still considering whether to accept the nomination to be a board member.  Pray for wisdom in how to run the membership meeting online.
		
		2. All Church ministries online: Continue to pray that Pastor Paul and Pastor Tang will learn to effectively preach online.  Pray that many people will use their extra time to participate in our online prayer meetings, Bible studies and fellowship meetings.  Pray for unchurched people to invite to participate in these online ministries.  
		
		3. English Congregation: Praise God that our online worship services have been going pretty smoothly during the past three Sundays.  However, last Sunday the worship leader's computer screen froze while she was leading worship.  Pray for wisdom for the English congregation leaders to know how to address this issue to prevent it from happening again.  Pray that people will truly worship the Lord and listen to the sermons though not physically present in our church building.  Pray that our pastors will adjust well to preaching online.
		
		4. English  Evangelistic Sunday on April 5, Pat Zukeran, who is an international speaker, an author of several books on apologetics, and the host of the radio show, "Evidences and Answers" will preach a sermon in the online English worship service entitled, "If God Is Powerful and Good, Why Does He Allow Suffering and Evil?".  His sermon will include applications and illustrations regarding the current coronavirus crisis.  After the worship service, he will answer questions that people submit to the following google form:    https://forms.gle/vJiCcoz635odVDVY7.  Pray for Pat's preparation and that the Holy Spirit will empower him to address people's hearts and minds.  Pray for non-Christians to invite to listen to the sermon and that they will respond to the gospel.  Pray that Pat will have wisdom to answer the questions accurately.
		
		5. Youth Fellowship: Our online youth nights have moved to Thursday nights.  Praise God that more youth are participating now than before the coronavirus crisis. Praise God that our youth workers are able to lead more consistently so that the ratio of youth workers to youth is actually better now.  The youth and parents have bought the book "30 Days to Understand the Bible."  Pray that they will finish their assignments every week so that they will become more biblically literate and love the Bible more
		
		6. CCCF’s Retreat on 4/6-10: Ambassador For Christ (AFC) and Cornell Chinese Christian Fellowship (CCCF) are organizing this year's retreat in the format of "Online Bible Study Camp" starting from April 6th to April 10th (five days in total) 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm every night. The speaker is "Tsun En Lu," and the theme is "How to Interpret Jesus's Parables," which is his PhD dissertation topic at Westminster Seminary. Brothers, sisters, and seekers at all age are all welcome to join this online retreat. Please pray for the speaker’s message preparation, and God’s abundant blessings in this retreat.
		
		7. Worship Service: Pray for the two worship services this coming Sunday by online.  Let us worship with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
		a. Speaker: Rev. Pastor Bin Tang will preach on “Time to be Drawn Near” from Poem16 in Chinese  Service and  Pat Zukeran from Hawaii will preach in English service.  Please pray for their sermons preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it. 
		b. Communion Service: communion will be served in both online worship services.  Pray for Pastor Tang and Pastor Paul that they will be able to officiate the services in a way that draws people to worship Christ for His great sacrifice.  Pray that members will obtain the bread and the grape juice or wine ahead of time, so that they will be able to participate in the service.


- Individuals
	
		1. Students Who Are Graduating in May: Many students in our church are graduating in May.  Many of them have to complete major thesis or project, and at the same time start looking for jobs or applying for graduate schools.  Pray for the strength and guidance they need from God.
		
		2. Singles: Let us pray for God’s guidance upon many single students in the area of relationship. Pray that Christians will honor God by firmly holding to biblical principles. Let us also pray that many seekers will entrust their future to God by faith, become members of God’s family, and build Christ-centered families with godly spouses that God provide for them.
