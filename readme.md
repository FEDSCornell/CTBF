## Prayer

- Missions/World
		
		1) Pray for God to bless the ministry of Second Wind Cottages in Ithaca: FICCC supports a Christian group in Ithaca called Second Wind Cottages that shares the gospel with homeless people and provides temporary housing for them in order to help them get back on their own feet. Pray that God blesses this ministry and uses it to draw many needy souls to Christ, especially in the midst of the pandemic and increased risk of homelessness.
	
		 2) Pray for Brother Li Yue as he prepares for full-time ministry: Li Yue was part of FICCC during his time at Cornell from 2005 to 2008 and feels a strong sense of calling to minister to Chinese students. FICCC started supporting his online theological study via Gordon-Conwell in January this year. Yue is currently seeking God’s guidance about when to shift to full-time study (he is leaning towards Fall 2021). Let’s pray for God to give him clear direction as he makes this decision, and to bless his study of the Bible to prepare him for effective ministry.



		

- Church

		1. Unity in Every Fellowship: Loving one another is not always easy, but when Christians in a fellowship do not fully commit themselves to this command that Jesus emphasized repeatedly, every member, as well as the whole fellowship will suffer. Let us use Philippians 1:27; 2:1-11 to encourage and remind one another.
		PHP 1:27 Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ... 2:1 If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, 2 then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose. 3 Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. 4 Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others. 5 Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: 6 Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, 7 but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. 8 And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death--even death on a cross! 9 Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
		1:27  只要你們行事為人與基督的福音相稱…同有一個心志，站立得穩，為所信的福音齊心努力。2:1 所以，在基督裏若有甚麼勸勉，愛心有甚麼安慰，聖靈有甚麼交通，心中有甚麼慈悲憐憫， 2 你們就要意念相同，愛心相同，有一樣的心思，有一樣的意念，使我的喜樂可以滿足。3 凡事不可結黨，不可貪圖虛浮的榮耀，只要存心謙卑，各人看別人比自己強；4 各人不要單顧自己的事，也要顧別人的事。5 你們當以基督耶穌的心為心：6 他本有神的形象，不以自己與神同等為強奪的；7 反倒虛己，取了奴僕的形象，成為人的樣式；8 既有人的樣子，就自己卑微，存心順服，以至於死，且死在十字架上。9 所以，神將他升為至高，又賜給他那超乎萬名之上的名，10叫一切在天上的、地上的和地底下的，因耶穌的名無不屈膝，11無不口稱「耶穌基督為主」，使榮耀歸與父神。
		
		2. Coworkers’ Inauguration: All elders, deacons, and coworkers from both congregations will have the annual coworkers’ inauguration in the two worship services this Sunday, 9/13. While none of us is perfect, let us pray that every coworker takes the commitment seriously and really has the heart to set good example in all areas for all church members to follow.
		
		3. Board Meeting on Sept 12:  The church board will meet on September 12 to make the decision on reopening. Pray God be with them and guide them to take all available information and make wisest decision. Pray that our church can effectively utilizes the church resources to provide opportunity for church ministries while keeping people physically as safe as possible.
		
		4. Chinese Adult Sunday School: Praise the Lord that 32 adults attended Chinese Adult Sunday School online the past Sunday.  Pray for more Christians to have the childlike heart to attend Bible class (Revelation) every Sunday as well.
		
		5. Evangelistic Meeting in October:  The annual Mandarin evangelistic meeting is coming in just a few weeks (10/23-25). At this stage, let us pray for the following:
		a.   Speaker: Ask God to give Prof. Der-Chen Chang’s words and guide him to prepare the message.
		b.   Seekers Already in Contact with Us: Start praying for each of the seeker individually.
		c.   Ourselves: Commit ourselves to praying for the seekers in these six weeks and to
		 inviting people when time comes closer.
		
		6. Chinese Fellowship Joint Meeting This Friday: There will be a Chinese fellowship joint meeting this Friday night at 7:30-9:00 PM online; the speaker is Min. Tsun-En Lu, Ph.D. candidate in Westminster Theological Seminary and Discipleship Training Ministry Assistant Director in Ambassadors for Christ, the topic is the Immeasurable Hope.  The Zoom ID is: 6119089970, and the password is: 2020. Pray that everyone will be prepared to join in the meeting.
		
		7. Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
		a. Speaker:  Min Tsun-En Lu will preach in the Chinese service on “The Stone that the Builder Rejected” from Psalm 118. Pastor Paul will preach in English worship service. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it.
		b. The people Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.
		

		

- Individuals

		1. The Students in fall semester:  Pray for students who return to school or take classes online at home, and ask God to help students and parents quickly adapt to the epidemic, new study/lifestyle during the period; also ask God to protect the safety of the students at schools, guard against the epidemic, and protect themselves physical health, learning more dependent on God.

		2. Healing and Comfort: Pray for our congregation members and theirfamilies who are going through struggles with illness and treatment. May God comfort and heal them and grant enduring strength and peace.
		
		3. Job Search: A few church members are looking for jobs. Pray for their job search, ask God to give them guidance, open doors for them, and at the meantime bless them with a peaceful mind.
