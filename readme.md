## Prayer

- Missions/World
		
		Guang Chong Kim. He recently reported that the funds are being used to “proclaim the gospel, provide food for the hungry, and provide healthcare to those much in need.” He also said that there are many people dying of COVID 19, including members of the churches that are part of the network established by his parents, and even a couple of pastors of these churches. Please pray for God’s comfort to the church families of those who have lost relatives, and especially the families of the pastors. Pray also that God would raise up more workers for the harvest field in Bolivia, and would continue to use the pandemic to bring many souls to Christ.

		2. Pray for Song Ye as he finishes his time of ministry with Cru in Orlando: Song Ye has spent the past year doing digital ministry with Cru at their headquarters in Orlando, and was able to keep working from home during the pandemic. His internship position at Cru was originally scheduled to finish up on May 1, but he has extended the time until the end of July. He has also begun to look for employment, but not surprisingly, it has been tough finding opportunities. Pray for Ye to finish his time at Cru well and to continue to bless many through the digital tools he has been working on. Let’s also ask the Lord to open a door for Ye to find useful work that utilizes his gifts and training after his internship ends.
		
		3. Reopening after the lockdown:  Pray for wisdom for government leaders in deciding when to allow citizens to return to their work and other activities.  Pray that their decisions will result in the economy being restored as soon as possible while a minimum number of people getting sick.  Pray that citizens will be wise in their practices to help minimize health problems.  Pray also for wisdom for our church leaders as they consider different factors to decide when to reopen our church's worship services and other ministries.  Pray that they will set up procedures so that people can worship and fellowship with each other while keeping physically safe.
		
		
										
		


- Church

		1. Praise - Seminary Extension Class on Bible Ethics:  Praise the Lord, the seminary extension class on “Bible Ethics” had a good start on Saturday, with 38 people attending, 12 of them  from our church. Please pray for Dr. Peter Chow and all the students, and ask God to bless their time of learning the Word of God.
		
		2. Pray for Board Meeting: The elders, deacons, and pastors will have a scheduled board meeting on this coming Saturday. One of the important issues to discuss is the church reopening. Pray and ask God to give them wisdom and guidance and to have unity in making decisions in church reopening and other issues.
		
		3. Fellowship Groups during Summer Time: Pray for God’s guidance, protection, and blessing upon all fellowship groups during summer time.  Pray that they will all be able to continue to attract more new comers and improve the quality of their weekly meetings.
		
		4. Personal Relationship with God: It’s inevitable that everyone will experience some struggles in life, especially in a very stressful environment. Sometimes there is no quick solution or simple fix.  What matters the most is that we stay close to God and ask Him to help us maintain healthy relationship with Him and with people around us.  Let us pray for ourselves and for people who are facing struggles.
		
		5. Our Daily Walk with God and Loving Relationship within Each family: Pray for brothers and sisters in our church that God may give all of us the desire to draw near to Him so that we would choose to get up earlier than usual during summer time and spend more quiet time with God through morning devotion, instead of staying up late spending much time on internet or computer games. Pray that our hearts may be filled with God’s love so that we may have the ability to love more and forgive more.
		
		6. English Congregation: This summer starting this Friday (6/12), English Congregation will have a College Bible Study every Friday from 7:00-8:30 pm.  The topic of the Bible study is "Experiencing God in College."  For many college students, a relationship with God is more theoretical than it is experiential.  As a result, Christianity becomes drab and irrelevant - rather than dynamic and meaningful.  And so, though our Bible study will be deeply rooted in Scripture, the emphasis of the Bible study will be for college students to experience God's love for them and let that love impact the way they experience college. Pray for God’s guideline and high attending rate.
		
		7. Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
		a. Speaker:  Rev. Derrick Tan will preach in the Chinese Worship service on “Contemporary Art” from Romans 11:33-36, Ephesians 2:10.   Pastor Paul will preach in English congregation. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it. 
		b. The people Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.
		


- Individuals
		1. Singles: Let us pray for God’s guidance upon many single students in the area of relationship. Pray that Christians will honor God by firmly holding to biblical principles. Let us also pray that many seekers will entrust their future to God by faith, become members of God’s family, and build Christ-centered families with godly spouses that God provide for them.
		
		2. Preparation for Moving: A few families will move away this summer or early Fall, e.g. Fan Yang/Yuling Huang,  Yimeng Sun, Jie Pei etc.  Pray for God’s guidance upon them in making all the preparatio
