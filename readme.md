## Prayer

- Missions/World
		
		1) Pray for Siu-Yuk and the Children of Promise career training center: Siu-Yuk helps to lead the Children of Promise ministry in East Asia, that helps people with physical and mental disabilities. This organization recently received funding from the local government to start a second career training center in the city where they are located. Pray that God will help Siu-Yuk and her coworkers to get this second center off to a good start, and would use it to open up natural opportunities to share the gospel.
 
		2) Pray for God to bless the ministry of Second Wind Cottages in Ithaca: FICCC supports a Christian group in Ithaca called Second Wind Cottages that shares the gospel with homeless people and provides temporary housing for them in order to help them get back on their own feet. Pray that God blesses this ministry and uses it to draw many needy souls to Christ, especially in the wake of the pandemic and increased risk of homelessness.							
		

- Church

			1. Church reopening:  Our church board members will meet on July 18 to discuss reopening the church.  On one hand, it would be much easier to reach out to new students if our church worship services and discipleship groups could meet in our church building.  On the other hand, we want people to remain safe.  Pray that our board members will be both wise and bold in following God's guidance for the church reopening.
			
			2. Our Daily Walk with God and Loving Relationship within Each family: Pray for brothers and sisters in our church that God may give all of us the desire to draw near to Him so that we would choose to get up earlier than usual during summer time and spend more quiet time with God through morning devotion, instead of staying up late spending much time on internet or computer games. Pray that our hearts may be filled with God’s love so that we may have the ability to love more and forgive more.
			
			3. The fellowship leader’s training class:  Praise the Lord, there are more than 10 coworkers from Fellowship groups taking the 4 time  online classes in past three weeks, there is last class will be this Sunday. Please pray all attenders can join the last class on time. 
			
			4. Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
			a. Speaker:  Min. 朱憲奔 from Syracuse will preach in the Chinese Worship service on “Let the Whole World Know” from 1 Samuel 17: 31-49. Pastor Paul will preach in English congregation. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it.
			b. The people Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.
			


- Individuals

			1. Sister Yiwen Qin ’s A-Exam This Wednesday : Sister Yiwen Qin (CCCF) will take online  A-exam  this Wednesday(7/8). Let us support her with prayer.
			
			2. F-1 and M-1 Students and visiting scholars visa: On Monday ICE issued the guidance on international students and Exchange visitor program to instruct that students and scholars how to keep their staying in State according their online classes. please pray the cornelland IC students from China( specially for them in China for Summer break) have the wisdom to handle the special situation .  Pray that they will seek guidance from God and receive all the wisdom and strength they need.
