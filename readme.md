## Prayer

### Missions/World 
1) Pray for our FICCC Mission Committee meeting this Thursday, 19 November: The FICCC Mission Committee will meet on Thursday this week via Zoom to discuss our church’s work in the area of missions. Pray that God would bless our discussion and give us wisdom and unity as we seek to make the very best use that we can of the resources He has given us to advance His kingdom around the world.

 2) Pray for Siu-Yuk as she ministers to the needy in East Asia: The organization that Siu-Yuk helps to lead in East Asia, Children of Promise, recently received approval from the local government to start a home care service and an activity center. Pray that God would graciously guide her steps as they develop these new forms of service and would bless the relationships that she and other members of Children of Promise form with local people through them, that those whose hearts are open might receive the gospel.




### Church                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
1. Governing Board Meeting Last Saturday: Thank you all for the prayers.  All three deacons (Jocelyn Bibert; Victor Chen, Dae Guang Chung Kim), Four elders (Mancang, Jianhua,Davidf), and two pastors (Tang Epp,) attended the online meeting,   By God’s grace the board members were able to follow the meeting agenda, discuss all items, and finish the meeting on time.  Please do continue to pray for all deacons, elders, and pastors.  Pray especially that they will serve God and His church with a pure heart that is pleasing to Him.

2. Evergreen’s Monthly Meeting This Saturday: Evergreen will hold its monthly meeting online this Saturday, from 9 AM to noon, Let us pray that many uncles and aunties will come to this early celebration of Thanksgiving, and God will use this meeting to speak to all of them.

3. Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday, let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voice to glorify our Lord 
a. Speskers: Brother Peng Tian will preach in the Chinese worship service on “Apostle Paul’s Defense” from 2 Corinthians11:1-15. Pastor Paul will preach in the English Service. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it.
b. People Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.




### Individuals
1. The Second wave of COVID 19 in NY State: There is evidence of second wave of COVID 19  in NY State as we saw the new cases daily more than thousands. Pray that we continue to be vigilant in taking protective and preventive measures as weather is getting colder and winter is setting in. If everyone is rigorous about mask use, physical distancing, appropriate hand hygiene, and avoids venues where masks are not used, especially indoor poorly ventilated spaces, the feared increase in new infections will hopefully be minimized.

2. New Christian Families Moving to Ithaca:  Recently, a few Chinese Christian families that have moved to Ithaca have attened our church online Sunday service.  Let us pray that they will feel led to choose our church as their spiritual home in Ithaca and they will join us to work together to make this church a better place for everyone to experience God’s love in Jesus Christ.

3. People Who Are Feeling Down: Pray for those who are down in spirit for various reasons—stress, set-back, spiritual issues, relationship problems, etc.  Pray that they will seek God’s face and follow God’s guidance to go through the valley.

4. Michael Cao’s B-Exam on Wednesday: Brother Mike Cao ( English Congregation) be defending his thesis this Wednesday, November 18th at 3:30 PM , please keep him your prayer.
