## Prayer
Missions/World 
1) Pray for Stuart and Peggy as they meet people at their new sending organization: Stuart and Peggy were recently forced to leave the country where they had been doing Bible translation for over thirty years and are now in the midst of a major transition in their life and ministry. Related to this, they have now changed their affiliation to a new mission sending organization called GlobalGrace Fellowship. They will meet the group’s Board of Directors in California on February 20, which is this week. Let’s pray for God to richly bless this time and knit their hearts together with this new support team, and to give them unity of vision as they seek God’s leading for future ministry.

2) Pray for God to use the “Power Over Fear” app that Song Ye has helped translate: Song Ye is serving with Cru this year at the group’s headquarters in Orlando doing digital ministry. Recently, he has helped to translate Cru’s Power Over Fear app (which is aimed at non-Christians) into Chinese and thousands have already downloaded it. Pray that it will get broad use in China, especially in the midst of the corona virus outbreak, and lead many people to faith in Christ. Let’s also pray for God’s blessing on Ye as he serves with Cru, and as he makes plans for what comes next.

  3) Pray for Derrick and Esther and their new English teaching intern: Praise God for providing Derrick and Esther with an English teaching intern until August! This will be a big help to them as they use teaching English to reach out to non-Christians in north Thailand. Pray for God to bless their relationship with this intern, so that they will be able to partner together effectively for the gospel. Pray especially that Esther will be able to do a good job overseeing the intern, along with her many other responsibilities. And let’s ask the Lord to draw Thai people to Himself through this ministry.

Church
1. English Congregation: I. Around a quarter of Cornell’s students are of Jewish heritage. Pray that we will have wisdom to reach out to them and introduce them to their Messiah. II. On Good Friday a former orthodox Jew who now ministers with Jews for Jesus will lead a Passover Seder & explain how Christ fulfills it. Pray for Jews to invite to the event.. III: Pray that new people will volunteer to help out with the FICCC youth and children’s ministry.  Pray that the workers will really love the youth and children and will disciple them to become genuine believers.

2. Church special member meeting on 3/1:  FICCC board calls for a call a special member’s meeting on 3/1 to approve a motion of selling the townhouse donated by a member. At its November 9, 2019 meeting, the board accepted the donation of the townhouse’s appreciation in Ithaca, NY from a church member by paying the donor’s remaining bank loan balance and selling it at the market value. The realized gain will be used to support Church’s ministries especially for the campus ministry. Please pray the special meeting.

3. Elders and Deacons Nomination: Continue to pray for God’s guidance upon those who are approached to fill some elder and deacon positions when the current term ends in late April.

4. Retreats Planning: There will be three retreats in the spring—CCCF fellowship retreat (3/27-30); Men’s Fasting & Prayer Retreat (4/10-11); Women’s Fasting & Prayer Retreat (4/3-4).  Different teams of people will be planning and making preparation for these retreats in these few weeks.  Pray for God’s guidance upon them.

5. Worship Service: Pray for the two worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
a. Speaker: Rev. Bin Tang will preach on “Seek the filling of the Holy Spirit” from Acts 6：5-6  in Chinese Service. Brother Aaron Hui  will preach in the English Service.  Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it. 
b. People Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.

Individuals
1. Campus Minister Candidate—Peng Tain:  His  mother in law is recovering very well previously and recently this process is slowing down and there is not so much improvement. Due to the virus situation in China, the physical therapy department has closed and there is no doctor available to help them to do the systematic therapy. The public transportation system is closed and his wife and father in law have to walk back forth between hospital and home. Each way is about 30 mins by walk. There is only a few groceries open and serve limited food and vegetables. His  mother in law can stay in the hospital since many patients including new patients have been turned away back home if the sickness is not severe. Please keep them in your prayer.

2. Job Search: Quite a few brothers and sisters still need our prayer support for their job search.  Some are waiting for result of job offer.  Some are going to have important interview.  Some are still waiting for job opportunities to surface.

3. Good Balance in Stressful Situation: Many people in our church have to deal with stress frequently.  While we pray for God’s strength and grace upon them, let us also pray for wisdom and maturity to learn to keep good balance in life, especially in the areas of setting priorities and time management.

4. School Break Travel: Cornell students (22-26/2), Elementary, middle and high school students (17-21/2) have this week break, let’s Pray for safe travels for those that will returning home/going out of town. Pray that students and faculty members will be well refreshed and energized.

Thanks!
