## Prayer

- Missions/World
		
		1)	Pray for Derrick and Esther as they serve in Thailand: FICCC’s Mission Committee had a good Zoom meeting with Derrick and Esther. Praise God for their faithful ministry to the Dai Yun people in Northern Thailand. Pray for Derrick’s language study, that the Lord will give him strong motivation and practical methods to help him really make progress. Also, pray for the language school that Esther is in charge of (which provides opportunity to meet non-Christians), for God to send them good teachers to help and that He blesses their efforts to share the gospel with students.
		
		2)	Pray that David and Susan could attend their son Ike’s wedding: David and Susan are based in a country in Asia near China and have been training Chinese Christians to engage in cross-cultural missions. Currently they are still under lockdown. They have airplane tickets to attend their son Ike’s wedding in the US, which is scheduled for July 11, but the airport is still closed. Pray that God might graciously open the door for them to fly to the US and be part of the wedding.
		
		3)	Pray for Siu-Yuk as she ministers to the handicapped in East Asia: Siu-Yuk has been helping to run a center to support the handicapped in a country in East Asia for the past ten years and is supported by our church. Her organization was recently allowed to do work in all the main districts of the city in which she is based. Pray that God would bless her work with handicapped in this city and that it would open natural doors for sharing the gospel and encouraging those who are already Christians.
		
		4)	 The Race-related riots in USA: This past week in the US has seen the worst race-related riots in decades following the death of a black man in the custody of white police officers in Minnesota. In the midst of this painful situation, let’s pray that God’s people around the country respond with wisdom and love to help bring healing and reconciliation. Pray that God would grant wisdom to government officials as they seek to stop the violence and to deal with the extremist groups that are seeking to exploit legitimate protests by turning them violent. Let’s also ask God to bring good out of this dark chapter by allowing a constructive conversation to emerge about how to improve race relations in the US.
		
		5)	Reopening after the lockdown:  Pray for wisdom for government leaders in deciding when to allow citizens to return to their work and other activities.  Pray that their decisions will result in the economy being restored as soon as possible while a minimum number of people getting sick.  Pray that citizens will be wise in their practices to help minimize health problems.  Pray also for wisdom for our church leaders as they consider different factors to decide when to reopen our church's worship services and other ministries.  Pray that they will set up procedures so that people can worship and fellowship with each other while keeping physically safe.
		
								
		


- Church

		1.	Fellowship Groups During Summertime: Pray for God’s guidance, protection, and blessing upon all fellowship groups during summertime. Very few Basil people are staying in town and they will join CCCF online to study the Book of Luke. CTBF is to start a new discipleship training class online. The three family fellowship groups are still hoping to attract more newcomers and some friends outside online Bible study.

		2.	Spiritual Preparation for Outreach in Fall Semester:  Even though most new students won’t arrive until two and half months later let us pray and ask God to prepare us to have a strong commitment and passion for reaching out to new comers.  May God make us strong and give us love for Him and for people He wants us to serve.  More specifically, pray for wisdom from God in knowing when and how to increase our outreach to Chinese students in Ithaca College.
		
		3.	Engling Congregation: I: This summer, Pastor Paul and two Cornell grad students (Felicia Setiono and Mark Dalthrop) will lead a Bible study for college students.  The purpose is to help students make the most of their time in college and to glorify God.  Pray for the three of them as they decide on the topics for the Bible study.  Pray that college students will join and attend consistently.  There are five high school seniors who will graduate this month who attend our church now or have in the past.  Pray that each of these students will decide to join.  II: This summer Pastor Paul will preach a series of sermons on Psalm 23.  Pray that this series will help people to experience the Lord as their Good Shepherd.  Pray that congregants will stay for the discussion groups that meet afterwards to discuss the sermon.  Several guest speakers will also speak this summer.  Pray that they will preach messages that will help the congregants grow spiritually.
		
		4.	Youth Group: Pray for our youth that they will attend our youth nights consistently and participate wholeheartedly. 
		
		5.	Children Sunday School: We would like to resume Children's Bible study on Sundays this Summer. Please pray for teachers‘ availabilities and spiritual strength to take those lessons.
		
		6.	Pray for Board Meeting: The elders, deacons, and pastors will have a scheduled board meeting on June 13. One of the important issues to discuss is the church reopening. Pray and ask God to give them wisdom and guidance and to have unity in making decisions in church reopening and other issues.
		
		7.	Seminary Extension Class on Bible Ethics: Continue to pray for the registration for the class. So far 11 have decided to take the class. The goal is to have about 18 people. Let us pray for Dr. Peter Chow’s preparation for all the messages he will give – 20 hours of teaching for the class, Sunday sermon on this coming Sunday.
		
		8.	Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
		a.	Speaker:  Rev.. Peter Chow will preach in the Chinese Worship service on “ The Thing Must Take Place” from Act 1:1-11.   Pastor Paul will preach in English congregation. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it. 
		b.	Communion: Pray for our readiness to take the communion.
		c.	The people Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.


- Individuals
	
		1.	Allergy and Other Illness: A few church members are suffering allergy problem or other illnesses. These problems can affect people’s productivity and daily life significantly.  Let us intercede for our brothers and sisters.

		2.	Good Balance in Stressful Situation: Many people in our church have to deal with stress frequently.  While we pray for God’s strength and grace upon them, let us also pray for wisdom and maturity to learn to keep good balance in life, especially in the areas of setting priorities and time management.
		
		3.	Travel Back China: Some students and visiting scholars want to go back to China in these several months and but have to rebook the tickets several times because of the pandemic travel ban. Please keep them in your prayer and ask God’s mercy.
