## Prayer

### Missions/World 
1) Pray for Stuart and Peggy’s Bible translation work: Stuart and Peggy are now based in back in Michigan and continuing with the work of Bible translation. Praise God that they’ve been getting long-delayed feedback on some of the OT books they finished some time ago. Pray that this feedback would continue, and that Peggy would continue to have opportunities for mentoring via email as she trains to work as a Bible translation consultant.
 
2) Pray for Derrick and Esther return to Thailand:  Derrick and Esther and their two kids are currently in California and waiting to return to Thailand, where they work as missionaries with OMF. They are still waiting to receive visas to return, which have been delayed due to the pandemic and recent pro-democracy protests in the country. Let’s pray that the protests would lead to constructive change, and that the Lord would graciously open a door for Derrick and Esther to receive their visas and return.
 
3) Pray for God to lead FICCC’s Mission Committee as they meet this month:The Mission Committee at FICCC meets twice each year to guide our church’s involvement in the work of missions, and the next meeting will be later this month. Pray that God’s Spirit leads the discussion of the Committee members and the decisions they make, so that FICCC can make the best use of its resources to support missions and the spread of the gospel worldwide.




### Church                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
1. Bible Read-a-thon: Praise the Lord! More than 20 people (adults, youths, and children) from the Chinese Congregations successfully completed last season’s Bible Read-a-thon. The new season of Bible Read-a-thon has begun on November 1st and will last till the end of April 2021. Let us continue to pray that one of the blessings people will experience in this church is the development of the health habit of daily devotional Bible reading.

2. Governing Board Meeting This Saturday Morning: Deacons, elders, and pastors will have a scheduled board meeting from 9:30 AM to noon time next Saturday(11/13) online. A few important issues of the church will be discussed and some preliminary planning for next year will be made. Let us pray and ask God to bless the team ministry of this group of leaders in our church. Let us also take this opportunity to pray for every deacon (   Wenchao Wang –outreach and caring,Jocelyn Bibert– English Ministry; Victor Chen—Youth Ministry, Dae Guang Chung Kim – Secretary,), every elder (Mancang Dong, Jianhua Chen, John Barwick and David Ng), every pastor (Bin Tang and Paul Epp) and their families. Church members are always welcome to sit in our board meetings.

3. English Congregation: Our English congregation has been challenged to pursue the "Baby Steps of Evangelism" with their non-Christian friends.  This includes praying for them daily, loving them, inviting them to evangelistic event, sharing their testimony, explaining the gospel and inviting them to become a Christian.  Pray that our disciples will do this and that as a result many non-Christians will become Christians. There have been a few non-Christians coming to our Bible studies, English worship and discipleship groups.  Pray that they will continue to attend and that that they will become Christians.

4. Youth Ministry: Several of our youth have not gotten baptized yet.  The logistics are more difficult because of the pandemic.  But still they can be baptized.  Pray that they will have a heart to get baptized, and for the logistics. There have been 3 or 4 non-Christian newcomers who have attended our youth nights.  Pray that they will continue to attend and they will become Christians. Last Friday, a couple of our youth led the Bible study in youth night and did a good job.  Pray that our youth will get more involved in leading our youth nights and thus take greater ownership of the youth ministry and grow in their commitment to the church and to Christ. The youth ministry has plans to have some of the youth nights meet in person in the basement of the church building.  Pray that this will help our youth participate more actively in our Bible studies.  Pray for safety.

5. The mountain stream team:  The Mountain Streams Team has not decided yet for sure whether they will be staying in Ithaca next semester or moving to East Asia.  Pray that they will be able to make that decision soon and make the necessary preparations for next semester.  They have been discipling many students.  Pray that they will make a lasting impact.

6. Annual Church Clean-up:  Due to the pandemic, we will have our church’s annual clean-up this coming Weekends, 11/8, 11/14 & 11/15. Pray for good weather, good participation, and a joyful spirit of working together to make our church yards and buildings cleaner and more beautiful.

7. Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday, let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voice to glorify our Lord 
a. Speskers: Rev. Joshua Luo from FL will preach in the Chinese worship service on “A biblical view on the wisdom of financial management” from 2 Corinthians 9:1-15. Pastor Paul will preach in the English Service. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it.
b. People Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.





### Individuals
1. Peace and Love in Every Family: Continue to pray for God’s guidance and love to work in families that are going through the process of repairing, rebuilding, and renewing.

2. Solid Spiritual Growth of All Families: Pray that through mutual encouragement, caring, prayer, no family or individual in our church will be left behind, but every one—adult and kid will be motivated to grow in their relationship with God and experience the abundant blessings God intends for us to receive.

3. The Fall semester ending:  All of Cornell's in-person classes this semester will finish before Thanksgiving.  Many students find it difficult to take classes online and feel lonely because of social distancing.  Pray that they will study hard, find the help they need, keep up their spiritual disciplines and find their joy in the Lord.

4. Members Whose Future Is Hanging in the Air: Quite a few church members are having the feeling that their immediate future seems to be hanging in the air. That includes some students who are graduating soon, people who need to look for job and graduate school, or people who are not sure about the major decisions they need to make soon.  Pray that they will continue to seek God and find peace in God’s presence in the midst of this challenging time.
