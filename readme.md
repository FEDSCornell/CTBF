## Prayer

- Missions/World
	1) Pray for Derrick as he travels to Laos for a visa: Derrick will leave on 25 February to get a new visa for Thailand and will come back on 29 February. Pray that the Lord will graciously bless this trip so that Derrick could successfully receive his visa and continue his ministry in Thailand. Let’s also ask God to protect his health while he is traveling, especially with the corona virus situation starting to significantly impact other Asian countries besides China.
	
	2) Pray for the corona virus situation in China and other countries: The corona virus outbreak that originated in China is now spreading more rapidly in other countries as well. Let’s pray for God to have mercy on China and on all those lands affected by the virus, and to grant wisdom and strength to all those who are trying to contain the virus, especially officials and doctors and researchers. Let’s ask the Lord to use this crisis to open people’s hearts to the gospel and use the Church to be a witness to His love and peace, especially in China.

- Church

	1. Fellowship Groups’ Leadership Transition: Continue to pray for God’s guidance upon those who are approached to fill some deacon positions when the current term ends in late April. Also continue to pray for some fellowship groups that are considering leadership change or adjustment for the next school year. 
	
	2. Elders and Deacons Nomination: Continue to pray for God’s guidance upon those who are approached to fill some elder and deacon positions when the current term ends in late April.
	
	3. Church Special Member Meeting on 3/1:  FICCC board calls for a call a special member’s meeting on 3/1 to approve a motion of selling the townhouse donated by a member. At its November 9, 2019 meeting, the board accepted the donation of the townhouse’s appreciation in Ithaca, NY from a church member by paying the donor’s remaining bank loan balance and selling it at the market value. The realized gain will be used to support Church’s ministries especially for the campus ministry. Please pray the special meeting.
	
	4. Adult Sunday School: The classes will be going into the fifth week the coming Sunday. Let us support the teachers and students of all classes with prayers. Pray for everyone to maintain consistent attendance and great learning attitude till the very end of this semester.
	
	5. Retreats Planning: Please continue pray for the planning of three retreats in the spring—CCCF fellowship retreat (3/27-30); Sister’s Fasting & Prayer Retreat (4/3-4).Men’s Fasting & Prayer Retreat (4/10-11);  Different teams of people will be planning and making preparation for these retreats in these few weeks.  Pray for God’s guidance upon them.
	
	6. Worship Service: Pray for the two worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
	a. Speaker: Rev. Bin Tang will preach on “Use Our Spiritual Gifts” from 1 Corinthians 12：1-11 ; Romans12：6-8  in Chinese Service. Pastor Paul  will preach in the English Service.  Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it. 
	b. Communion: Pray for our readiness to take the communion.
	c. People Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.

- Individuals

	1. Job Search and School Application: Pray for church members who are eagerly waiting for good result of their job and school applications. Some might get the result in these few weeks.
	
	2. Emotional and Spiritual Issues: Pray for a few church members who are struggling with emotional and spiritual issues due to e.g. depression, stress, interpersonal conflict, sins, etc.  Pray especially for those who need more encouragement and caring to come to church.
	
	3. Christian Professors in Our Church: It is not easy to be a college professor.  It can be even more challenging for Christian professors to teach in secular schools.  But at the same time there are also great opportunities for Christian professors to make an impact to many people on campus. Let us give thanks to God for all the Christian professors in our church, and pray and ask God to watch over them in their teaching, research, family, health, involvement in the church, and witnessing for Christ.
