## Prayer
	
- Missions/World
		
		1) Pray for David and Susan as they face the corona virus along with their students: A number of Chinese students who David and Susan have been training for cross-cultural missions returned to China recently, but 12 others are staying with them because flights back home were blocked. Pray that God will keep them safe from infection and will bless the time they have together in the city where they are, which is currently under lockdown.

		2) Pray for Brother Li Yue as he prepares for full-time ministry: Li Yue was part of FICCC during his time at Cornell from 2005 to 2008, and still keeps in touch with a number of our church members. He is currently studying theology part-time online via Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and plans to shift to full-time study starting in 2021. He feels a strong sense of calling to ministry among Chinese students. FICCC started supporting his theological study in January this year. Let’s pray for God to bless his preparation for ministry.
		
		3) Coronavirus Pandemic:  The coronavirus pandemic may be the biggest worldwide crisis of our generation.  In our reaction to this crisis, may we follow the Lord's guidance to pray, "Thine kingdom come, they will be done on earth as it is in heaven," and "Not my will, but Your's be done."  May we pray that God will bring good out of the suffering and that revival will break out as people consider their mortality.  In Psalm 41:1, King David writes, "Blessed are those who have regard for the weak; the Lord delivers them in times of trouble."  May the crisis motivate those who are blessed with strength to help the weak. Pray for researchers to find cures for disease, government leaders to make wise decisions to save lives and jobs, educators to help their students learn, the wealthy to be generous to the poor, and spiritual leaders to counsel the depressed and lead them to the Lord.

		5. CCCF’s Retreat on 4/6-10: Ambassador For Christ (AFC) and Cornell Chinese Christian Fellowship (CCCF) are organizing this year's retreat in the format of "Online Bible Study Camp" starting from April 6th to April 10th (five days in total) 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm every night.

Brothers, sisters, and seekers at all age are all welcome to join this online retreat. Please pray for the speaker’s message preparation, and God’s abundant blessings in this retreat.
		
		6. Worship Service: Pray for the two worship services this coming Sunday by online.  Let us worship with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
		a. Speaker: Rev. Pastor Bin Tang will preach on “The Hope in the Pandemic"  from 1 Corinthians15:20-28 in Chinese Service and  Pastor Paul will preach in English service.  Please pray for their sermons preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it. 




- Individuals
	
		1. Students Who Are Graduating in May: Many students in our church are graduating in May.  Many of them have to complete major thesis or project, and at the same time start looking for jobs or applying for graduate schools.  Pray for the strength and guidance they need from God.

		2. Personal Relationship with God: It’s inevitable that everyone will experience some struggles in life, especially in a very stressful environment. Sometimes there is no quick solution or simple fix.  What matters the most is that we stay close to God and ask Him to help us maintain healthy relationship with Him and with people around us.  Let us pray for ourselves and for people who are facing struggles.
