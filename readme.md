## Prayer

### Missions/World 
1) Pray for Abi as she prepares for short-term mission to Africa: Abi Bernard from the English congregation at FICCC is hoping to leave for a seven month short-term mission trip to the African country of Ivory Coast with Cru in mid-November. The main factor that could affect her departure is the presidential election that Ivory Coast will have on 31 October. Let’s pray for God to give peace to Abi as she waits for confirmation that she can go, and also ask the Lord for His gracious hand of protection over the election in Ivory Coast so there won’t be any significant unrest.

2) Pray for God to bless the ministry of Second Wind Cottages in Ithaca: FICCC supports a Christian group in Ithaca called Second Wind Cottages that shares the gospel with homeless people and provides temporary housing for them in order to help them get back on their own feet. Pray that God blesses this ministry and uses it to draw many needy souls to Christ, especially in the midst of the pandemic and increased risk of homelessness.



### Church                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
1. Praise the Lord!!!!Mandarin Evangelistic Meetings:  Praise the Lord that by God’s grace and His own mighty work our online evangelistic meetings last weekend went very well.  Most people felt very positive after hearing the message given by Prof. Der-chen Chang. More than 130 person from our church and other area joined the online meetings, and quite a few seekers attended all three or two of the three meetings.  Among seekers total 8 people check-marked on the response card that they decided to accept Jesus; We should also thank God that so many coworkers worked very hard behind the scene; many brothers and sisters made serious effort to personally invite their friends; and many prayed really faithfully behind the scene. 

2. Chinese Congregation Coworkers’ Meeting: The Chinese Congregation coworkers will have a scheduled bi-monthly meeting online from 1:30 to 2:30 PM this coming Sunday afternoon. Major issues for discussion include Christmas Eve program and future evangelistic meetings. Let us pray and ask God to guide these coworkers to have a very productive discussion and decision making. Let us also remember to pray for the Chinese Ministries coordinators and all fellowship leaders and their families.

3. Bible Read-a-thon:  The new season of Bible Read-a-thon will begin on November 1st and will last till the end of April 2021. Let us continue to pray that one of the blessings people will experience in this church is the development of the healthy habit of daily devotional Bible reading.

4. Halloween: In the past many years our church has joined many other churches to discourage church members and their children to participate in Halloween activities. Praise the Lord that more and more public schools in Ithaca have decided not to organize Halloween activities during and even after school because they have recognized that now there is a national trend to respect many families’ belief against these activities.  Let us continue to pray that our church members and especially those who have children will make wise and godly decision around this time of the year.

5. Solid Spiritual Growth of All Families: Pray that through mutual encouragement, caring, prayer, no family or individual in our church will be left behind, but every one—adult and kid will be motivated to grow in their relationship with God and experience the abundant blessings God intends for us to receive.

6. Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday, let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voice to glorify our Lord 
a. Speakers: Rev. Bin Tang will preach in the Chinese worship service on “Poverty and Abundance Transformed" from 2 Corinthians 8：1-24. Pastor Paul will preach in the English Service. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it.
b. Communion: Pray for our readiness to take the communion.
c. People Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.



### Individuals
1. Follow-Up After Evangelistic Meetings: Pray for many seekers who responded to the altar calls in the evangelistic meetings.  Pray that through good follow-up by our fellowship coworkers great majority of them will have a clearer understanding of what it means to be followers of Christ and they will become even firmer in making this commitment.  Pray also for Christians who responded to the speaker’s challenge and invitation on Sunday morning.  Pray that all will seek God’s face and follow the lead of the Holy Spirit to start experiencing breakthrough in personal relationship with God in their daily walk.

2. New Comers Who Are Christian: Praise the Lord that God has brought several Christian students and families to our Chinese Congregation in this semester. Let us pray that they will adjust well to the new environment, feel warmly welcomed in our church, and soon follow God’s guidance to find their roles to serve in a fellowship group and in the church.

3. Job and School Application: Pray for church members who are currently applying for jobs or schools, including some high school seniors who are applying for college. Pray for God’s guidance upon them and for their trust in God.
