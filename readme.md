## Prayer

### Missions/World 
1) Pray for Derrick and Esther’s English/Mandarin school Christmas outreach in Thailand: One of the important avenues of outreach to the Northern Thai people that Derrick and Esther have had is an English/Mandarin language school that they and some other missionaries have helped to run. This coming Saturday (19 Dec) the school will have a Christmas party. Pray that the ten students at the school will be willing to attend and that the Lord might prepare their hearts to hear (and the missionaries’ hearts to share) the wonderful message of Jesus and why He came.

2) Pray for Siu-Yuk and the work of the Career Support Center that she has started: Siu-Yuk’s organization, called Children of Promise, has started a Career Supporting Center in East Asia for people with disabilities. They are seeing lives changed by sharing the love and message of Jesus with those who come to them. However, they have had difficulty finding clients who meet all of the criteria required by the government. Let’s pray that the Lord would have mercy on the Center and would guide Siu-Yuk and her coworkers as they try to find the best way to deal with this problem.



### Church                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
1. Preparation Christmas Eve Program: Let us continue to pray for the preparation of Christmas Eve program which will be held online next Thursday, 12/24, from 8:00-9:30 PM. Pray that

b. Many seekers will join and be touched by the Christmas message conveyed through the songs and sermon.
c. God will use John Barwick’s short message to touch everyone’s heart.
d. All parts of the program will be well coordinated and the message of Christmas will be clearly presented throughout the evening.

2. Bible Reading and Daily Devotion: It’s not uncommon for Christians to set the goal of having more consistent daily devotion and Bible reading in a new year. Pray that we will all take it as a joy to be reminded, encouraged, and empowered by the Holy Spirit to read God’s Word as our spiritual food every day.  Pray also that people who signed up for the church’s Bible Read-a-thon program will maintain the momentum and make good progress during Winter Break.

3. Worship Service: Pray for the two worship services this coming Sunday, let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voice to glorify our Lord 
a. Speakers: Rev. Zhiqiu Xu from Worcester, MA will preach in the Chinese worship service on “Strength in Weakness” from 2 Corinthians 13:1-4.  Brother Jonathan Aling will preach in the English worship service. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it.
b. People Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.
