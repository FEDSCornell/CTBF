## Prayer

- Missions/World
	
	1) Pray for David and Susan as they train Chinese Christians in missions: David and Susan are serving in a country close to China, where they are training Christians  from China how to engage in cross-cultural missions. Due to the corona virus, their Chinese students, who are staying with local non-Christian families, have been asked not to go out and about. Pray for God to give these Chinese believers peace and patience in the midst of the current uncertainty, and for the light of their faith to shine brightly before their host families, so that they might come to know Christ.
	
	2) Pray for Abi Bernard as she serves with Cru at Cornell this semester: Abi is an active member of the English congregation who just graduated from Cornell in December and is engaged in full-time campus ministry with Cru at Cornell this semester. Let’s pray that God blesses her relationships with students and uses her to lead those who are not yet believers to become genuine followers of Christ.
	
	3)   Coronavirus outbreak in US: Let’s all pray hard for the global  coronavirus attack and the current outbreak in US and New York State.  May the Lord protect, intervene, and heal.  Pray that those who are in fear and have anxiety would find the God of peace and hope. And, as we live in this E-World where social media becomes an effective means to empower us to make an impact,  may it be a time where we can continue to bring good news to people!
