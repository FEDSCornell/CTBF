## Prayer

### Missions/World 
1) Pray for Derrick as he recovers from pacemaker surgery: Derrick is still in the US waiting to return to Thailand and recently had surgery to implant a pacemaker. So far the doctor has detected three episodes with a fast heartbeat over the course of a month. Let’s pray that Derrick would continue to recover well and that God would grant the doctor wisdom in adjusting his medication to resolve the occasional fast heartbeat issue.

2) Pray for Zheng Mingzhang and his wife Xiuhui as they reach out to young people in Taiwan: Zheng Mingzhang and his wife Xiuhui are former members of FICCC doing gospel work in a rural town in Taiwan where there are few Christians. Let’s pray that the 6 new children who recently entered the cram school Mingzhang has established there would adapt well and would be open to the gospel.



### Church                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
1. Evangelistic Meeting in October:  The annual Mandarin evangelistic meeting is only 10 days away (10/23-25).  Pray for our own active involvement in the following area:
a) We will be faithful in prayer for the work of the Holy Spirit in this major outreach event.
b) We will be in action to invite people around us and every one that God brings to our mind.
c) We will be watchful over our own heart, spiritual wellbeing, and testimony at home, school and the workplace.
d) We will be supportive of one another, knowing that God desires our whole church to serve Him as an unified team.
e) We will be humble and ready to fill in any gap to make this evangelistic meeting that brings God the glory.
f) We will be convicted again that it was God’s grace that saved us through the blood of Jesus Christ.
g) We will be challenged to love Him and serve Him with our very best, and our passion and commitment will be renewed.

2. Growth and Fruit-bearing of Every Christian:  While we are holding evangelistic meetings with the hope of leading more people into the Body of Christ, let us also pray that Christians in our church (especially those who got baptized here) bear good testimony for Christ, and other can really see from our lives that we are committed followers of Christ. Pray that no Christian in our church will stay spiritually immature for years, turn lukewarm and become salt that lost its saltiness. Let us heed the warning in Hebrews 10:25 “Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching.”

3. Bible Reading: The current season of Bible Read-a-thon will end on 10/31, pray for those who are still striving to finish the reading for the current season. Also pray that more people will make serious effort to build up the habit of daily Bible reading in the following six months.

4. Evergreen Fellowship Monthly Meeting Online This Saturday: Evergreen will have their monthly meeting online this Saturday, 10/17, from 9AM to noon,  Min Peng Tian willlead the Bible Study online. Pray for a good attendance and a good fellowship time.

5. Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
a. Speaker:  Rev. Bin Tang will preach in the Chinese worship service on “From Sorrow to Joy” from 2 Corinthians 7:1-16.   Pastor Paul will preach in the English worship. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it.
b. The people Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.

### Individuals
1. Lordship of Christ in Every Family: Let us pray that God will truly be revered and exalted in every family, and while family members might at times find it difficult to submit to each other they will be reminded to humble and soften their hearts before God.  Pray that as people submit themselves to God’s sovereignty it enables the Spirit of God to pour down more of God’s love into their own hearts and into their family relationship.

2. Job Searching: Please pray for the efforts of new college graduates or anyone who is now looking for a job.

3. Healing and Comfort: Pray for our church members and their families who are going through struggles with illness and treatment. May God comfort and heal them and grant enduring strength and peace.

4. People Who Are Under Stress: A lot of our members, especially students, are living in a very stressful situation almost every day. Some also have to deal with various kinds of health issue.  Let us pray for and encourage one another. May the God of hope fill us with all joy and peace as we trust in Him, so that we may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. (Romans 15:13).
