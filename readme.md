## Prayer

- Missions/World
		
		1) Pray for Siu-Yuk and the Children of Promise career training center:  Siu-Yuk helps to lead the Children of Promise ministry in East Asia, that helps people with physical and mental disabilities. This organization recently received funding from the local government to start a second career training center in the city where they are located. Pray that God will help Siu-Yuk and her coworkers to get this second center off to a good start, and would use it to open up natural opportunities to share the gospel.
		
		2) Pray for Xing Siyao and her husband He Yang with a newborn baby and need for visa: FICCC supported Siyao during her study at Westminster Seminary until she graduated last year. She and her husband are now in Boston, where he is doing church ministry and Siyao gave birth to a baby girl in March. Pray for God to grant them grace to care well for the baby, especially once Siyao’s mom returns to China this month. Let’s also pray that Yang would receive the visa he has been waiting for since last year, as his OPT recently ended and he cannot officially work until his visa is approved. 
		
		3) East Asia Cru staff in Ithaca:  Cru (formerly Campus Crusade) had over 200 staff serving in China who had to return to the United States due to COVID19.  They are not yet allowed to return, so Cru has been searching for places for these staff members to minister during the fall semester.  They have decided to send 8-10 staff members to serve in Ithaca - particularly ministering to college students.  FICCC is housing 6-8 of them either in the House of Joy or in the house of a family who will be in China during the fall semester.  These staff members will evangelize and disciple students - particularly among CCCF, BASIL, the English congregation, Cru and CBS.  Pray for wisdom in mobilizing them, pray for effective outreach and discipleship.  Cru is still searching for one more place to house either a couple or two single women.  Pray that they will find a place that is low rent and close to the Cornell campus.

								
		

- Church

		1. Church reopening:  On July 18 our church board members decided to postpone until September 12 the decision to reopen the church.  This decision was based on wanting to wait to find out whether the arrival of Cornell students will result in an increase in positive cases of COVID19.  Pray that our board members will be both wise and bold in following God's guidance for the church reopening.  Pray that there will be no increase in positive cases so that our church can reopen soon.

		2. Fellowship Leaders:  As the new semester is about to begin, let us remember to pray for our fellowship leaders and their families on a regular basis.
		
		3. Adult Sunday School: Pray for God’s guidance upon all Chinese Adult Sunday School teachers who will be making the preparation in these few weeks before the classes.
		
		4. Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
		a. Speaker:  Rev. Bin Tang will preach in the on “Receiving Comfort in Tribulation” from 2 Corinthians 1: 1-11. Pastor Paul will preach in English worship service. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it.
		b. The people Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.
					
								


- Individuals

		1. Prof. Jim Dai: Brother Jim Dai fall from his bike on last Thursday and broke some bones, had a smooth surgery on Monday, please pray for his recovery and prevent from the coronavirus when he in hospital.  

		2. Leaving Ithaca in this week: 
		A. On 8/11 Haiyan He and Hepeng Jia family is leaving Ithaca for airport then back  to China on 8/12, then after 14 days quarantine in Shanghai, will settle down in Suzhou, Please pray their safety and healthy travel. 
		B. Yang Fan and Yuling Family is moving to Seattle to start Fan’s  new work, please pray for their move out  on 8/14 and leaving  on 8/15. Keep them and family in your prayer.
		
		3. New Comers to Our Church: A few new comers have been joining to our church online service and Friday online bible study  Pray that they will feel at home and feel comfortable to have more interactions with members in our church.
		
		4. Job Searchers: With bad economy and funding freeze a few church members who are looking for jobs have experienced one after another setback. Pray for God’s bestowing of comfort, peace, and confidence in their hearts.
