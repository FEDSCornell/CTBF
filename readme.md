## Prayer

- Missions/World
	
	1) Pray for God’s protection over Derrick and Esther as they minister in Thailand: As with a growing portion of the world, the COVID19 virus has hit the livelihoods of the Tai-Yuan people in North Thailand quite hard. Pray that God will use these challenging times to turn people’s hearts to Him, and will use Derrick and Esther as effective messengers of the gospel to those around them. Pray also for the Lord’s protection over their health of their whole family, and especially for Derrick, who has asthma and is therefore at higher risk from the virus. 
	
	2) Pray for Zhang Tao and Yingyun as their third child is due on March 22: Zhang Tao is in his last semester of study at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and he and his wife Yingyun are expecting their third child on March 22. Pray for God’s gracious protection over the whole delivery process in the midst of the corona virus crisis. Praise God for the offers of support from brothers and sisters once the baby is born. Let’s also pray for special grace for Zhang Tao as he finishes up his last three courses, teaches two Sunday school classes, and supports Yingyun.
	
	3)   Coronavirus Pandemic:  We are going through uncharted waters as we respond to the coronavirus crisis.  Leaders in the government, educational, medical, business and churches do not have the experience or expertise to know how to respond to the various issues related to this crisis.  But we can have peace that in the midst of these troubled waters, that Christ is the Captain of our ship (particularly our fellowship).  And the Bible promises that when we go through trials like this, that if we ask God for wisdom, He will give it to us generously (see James 1:2-8).  So let's pray that government, education, medical, business and church leaders  will humble themselves and seek God's wisdom to address 


- Church

	1. Students in the Coronavirus crisis:  Pray for students who face the difficulties of taking classes online and seeking jobs or internships.  Pray that parents will have wisdom about how to take care of their children while they work.  Pray for people who have to stay home from work that God would supplies their needs.  Pray for medical researchers that they will find a cure for the coronavirus.  Pray that the coronavirus will soon fizzle away.

	2. All Church ministries online: The FICCC board met last Saturday and decided that all FICCC ministries will go online.  Thank God that the English and Chinese online worship services went well.  We estimate that around 50 people participated in the English service and 55 in the Chinese service.  Pray that Pastor Paul and Pastor Tang will learn to effectively preach online.  Pray that many people will use their extra time to participate in our online prayer meetings, Bible studies and fellowship meetings.  Pray for unchurched people to invite to participate in these online ministries.  
	
	3. English Congregation: Pastor Paul plans to have an online new membership class on Wednesday.  Pray that many English congregation participants will participate and decide to become members.  Pray that God would lead you to reach out to lonely and needy people online.
	
	4. Jesson Peng Tian: Because of the coronavirus, the FICCC elders and pastors decided to postpone Jesson Peng Tian's candidacy trip again.  Thank God that Jesson accepted the news well.  Pray for guidance for Jesson and our church as we plan to invite him to come back after the coronavirus crisis has subsided.  Pray for direction and timing as to whether God is leading Jesson to become our church's campus minister.  In addition, please pray over the attached letter from Jesson in which he shares the good news about his mother-in-law's health recovery and other ways in which God is working in his life."
	
	
	5. Bible Read-a-thon: The deadline for finishing this season’s Bible Read-a-thon is approaching – April 30. Pray that many will finish the reading on time. In the Chinese service this coming Sunday there will be a promotion and sign up for next six months’ Bible Read-a-thon. Pray that more people will sign up and more people will build up the habit of daily Bible reading, and systematically read through the whole Bible.
	
	6. Governing Board Meeting: The elders, deacons, and pastors will have a scheduled board meeting the coming Saturday through Zoom online. They will need to finalize the budget proposal for year 2021 and also finalize the elder/deacon nomination slate. Pray and ask God to give them wisdom and guidance.   Also pray for unity among them as they discuss important issues of our church.

	a. Speaker: Brother Jianhua Chen will preach on “Living with the Holy Spirit” from John 14:15-17  in Chinese  Service and Pastor Paul will preach in English service.  Please pray for their sermons preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it. 
	

- Individuals
	
	1. Travel in the coronavirus pandemic:  Cornell has suspend all class in campus last Friday and all undergraduate students shall be go their permanent home residences. Please keep them in your prayer, and special pray for Xiaoyu Li, she is going to Shanghai on 3/19. 

	2. College Admission: Many colleges will send admission notice around March 31/April 1.  Pray for the high school seniors in our church who are waiting for the results. May God give them clear guidance when they have multiple choices. Let us also begin to pray for the kids who will come to study at Cornell and Ithaca College this Fall. Pray that God will bring many Christians to our church and work together with us to strengthen more fellowships, e.g. CCCF, CTBF, and family fellowships; and that God will also bring many seekers to our church to hear the Gospel and come to know the grace of God.
	
	3. Students Who Are Moving Away This Summer: Many students in our church are graduating or moving away this summer.  Many of them have to complete major thesis or project, and at the same time start looking for jobs or applying for graduate schools.  Pray for the strength and guidance they need from God.
