## Prayer

### Missions/World
		
1) Pray for David and Susan as they shift their home assignment to this year: David and Susan returned to the US over the summer to attend their son’s wedding, and were planning to head back to their host country near China as soon as flights resumed, but now all of the different seminaries and groups that were planning to send students for training have postponed until next summer. Therefore, David and Susan have decided to shift their home assignment (originally due to start next summer) to right now, and head back to the field next summer. So let’s pray that God will bless this the next 11 months for them and that they will be able to connect well with their supporting churches (including FICCC) in spite of the pandemic.

2) Pray for Abi Bernard as she hopes to do a year-long mission in Africa : Abi Bernard, part of the English congregation at FICCC who recently graduated from Cornell, is back in Ithaca serving with Cru and waiting to depart for a year-long short-term mission to the African country of Ivory Coast. Due to the pandemic, the earliest she would be able to leave is November 1st. Pray that God would continue to lead her steps and might graciously open the door for her to go to Africa. In the meantime, let’s also pray that He would bless Abi’s ministry with Cru at Cornell while she waits for her departure.


### Church

1. Fellowship Leaders: Probably only those who have served as fellowship leaders know how challenging it is to lead fellowship groups. Even great leaders like Moses, Nehemiah, Paul, and even Jesus had to deal with many headaches both from outside and inside. Let us continuously pray for the coordinator(s) not only of our own fellowship groups but also of other groups. In the meantime, pray for ourselves to be grateful and choose to be God’s vessel to give the best support to our fellowship leaders.

2. Church Reopening: Due to the recent increase of COVID-19 cases in Ithaca and campuses ,, our church board has decided to continue online worships and update related equipment. Please pray for the church's activities in this special time . 

3. Chinese Congregation Coworkers’ Meeting: The Chinese Congregation coworkers have a scheduled bi-monthly meeting at 1:30 PM online this coming Sunday. The most important issue is how to organize the Fall EV Meeting in October and Campus Minister Candidate  Peng Tian visiting  . Pray that God will guide the proceeding of this bi-monthly meeting with His Spirit, and that this will be a time of wise and effective planning and blessed fellowship.

4. Evangelistic Meeting in October:  The annual Mandarin evangelistic meeting is coming in just a few weeks (10/23-25). At this stage, let us pray for the following:
a.   Speaker: Ask God to give Prof. Der-Chen Chang’s words and guide him to prepare the message.
b.   Seekers Already in Contact with Us: Start praying for each of the seeker individually.
c.   Ourselves: Commit ourselves to praying for the seekers in these six weeks and to
 inviting people when time comes closer.

5. Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
a. Speaker:  Rev. Bin Tang will preach in the Chinese service on “Live Out a Life Risen from the Dead” from 2 Corinthians 4:1-15.   Pastor Paul will preach in English worship service. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it.
b. The people Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.

		

### Individuals

1. Brother Jiahe Chen Q-exam in this week:  Jiahe Chen will take his Q-exam on 9/15 and 9/18. Please keep him in your prayer.
 
2. Christian Professors: Pray for the Christian professors in our church. Pray and ask God to bless their teaching and research, and that they will continue to be used by God to make a strong and positive impact to their students and people who work with them. Also, pray for God’s protection and blessing on their relationship with their spouse and children.

3. High School Seniors’ College Application: This year quite a few youth group kids are seniors in high school and they will soon start applying for colleges. For some of the kids and their parents this can become a very time-consuming and energy draining process. Pray for God’s clear guidance upon every one of them.

4. Mao Huang’s Mother Travels back to China: The mother of Mao Huang(CTBF) is flying  back to China on Thursday.  Pray for her smooth travel and continual growth in faith.
