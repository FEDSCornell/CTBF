## Prayer

- Missions/World
		
		1) Pray for Abi Bernard as she prepares for a year-long mission in Africa:
		Abi Bernard has been a faithful member of our English congregation for the past several years, first as an undergraduate student at Cornell (she graduated in December 2019) and these past six months as a full-time intern with Cru at Cornell. She is now preparing to serve with Cru for a year in the nation of Ivory Coast in Western Africa, where she will be reaching out to students. Pray that God guides her steps, as the current pandemic has created much uncertainty, and abundantly provides for all of her financial needs should He open the door for her to go, as seems likely. Let’s also ask the Lord to make Abi a channel of His saving grace to many needy souls in that country.
		
		2) Pray for Zhang Mingzhang and his wife Xiuhui ministering in rural Taiwan
		FICCC has recently begun supporting Zhang Mingzhang and his wife Xiuhui, who are former members of our church now doing full-time ministry in rural Taiwan, which is a difficult mission field. Pray that God continues to give them favor in the village where they minister and doors of opportunity to share the gospel. Pray especially that the Lord would use the tutoring school they have started to turn the hearts of the students to Christ.

						
		

- Church

			1. Church reopening:  Continue to pray for our church board meeting on July 18. The main purpose is to discuss reopening the church.  On one hand, it would be much easier to reach out to new students if our church worship services and discipleship groups could meet in our church building.  On the other hand, we want people to remain safe.  Pray that our board members will be both wise and bold in following God's guidance for the church reopening

			2. Governing Board Meeting: The elders, deacons, and pastors will have a scheduled  online board meeting on Saturday morning, 7/18 (9:30 AM – noon). Pray and ask God to give them wisdom and guidance.  Also pray for unity among them as they discuss important issue- reopening of Church.
			
			3. Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
			a. Speaker:  Rev. Bin Tang from Syracuse will preach in the Chinese Worship service on “God is Our Mighty Comforter” from Isaiah 40: 12-26. Pastor Paul will preach in English congregation. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it.
			b. The people Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.
			
						


- Individuals

		1. Sister Yiwen Qin passed her A exam: Praise Loead and thank for your prayer, Sistr Yiwen Qin passed her online A-exam smoothly on last Wednesday.  

		2. Singles: Let us pray for God’s guidance upon many single students in the area of relationship. Pray that Christians will honor God by firmly holding to biblical principles. Let us also pray that many seekers will entrust their future to God by faith, become members of God’s family, and build Christ-centered families with godly spouses that God provides for them.
		
		3. Health Issues: A few people in our church are dealing with various kinds of health issues. Some are still looking for possible treatment, some need time to see improvement. Let us support them with prayers and caring.
		
		4. People Moving Away: Quite a few people, including Christians and seekers, are moving away this summer. Some have just left.  Pray for God’s guidance upon them throughout the transition and that they will all find Christians who are able to help them to continue to grow in their relationship with God.
