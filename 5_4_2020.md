## Prayer
	
- Missions/World
		
		1) Pray for God to use missionaries in Bolivia to help during coronavirus crisis: FICCC member Dae-Guang Kim grew up in a Korean missionary family that serves in Bolivia. He recently learned from his father that the harsh coronavirus lockdown in Bolivia has created great hardship for many people, especially those in the lower classes. Quite a few people are unable to get enough food, which has led to desperation and even suicides, while abuse and violence in families has skyrocketed. Pray for God to have mercy on Bolivia, and to use Dae-Guang’s father and their ministry in the country to bring practical help and the hope of the gospel to many in great need.

		2) Pray for Zhang Tao and Yingyun as they seek God’s leading for their next step: Praise God that Yingyun had a smooth delivery of their third daughter in March! Tao is about to finish his theological study at Gordon-Conwell Seminary and he and his family are seeking the Lord about their next step. Tao plans to go back to China to be a pastor, but he needs to get a visa from the Chinese embassy in New York for his newborn daughter before he can do so, which has not been possible because of the coronavirus situation. He is now considering possibly finding a position as an intern at a Chinese church in the US for a year before heading back. Let’s pray for God to bless Tao and Yingyun’s new daughter, to grant Tao grace to finish his last term of study well, and to give them clear guidance concerning their next step.
		
		3) Coronavirus Pandemic:  The coronavirus pandemic may be the biggest worldwide crisis of our generation.  In our reaction to this crisis, may we follow the Lord's guidance to pray, "Thine kingdom come, they will be done on earth as it is in heaven," and "Not my will, but Your's be done."  May we pray that God will bring good out of the suffering and that revival will break out as people consider their mortality.  In Psalm 41:1, King David writes, "Blessed are those who have regard for the weak; the Lord delivers them in times of trouble."  May the crisis motivate those who are blessed with strength to help the weak. Pray for researchers to find cures for disease, government leaders to make wise decisions to save lives and jobs, educators to help their students learn, the wealthy to be generous to the poor, and spiritual leaders to counsel the depressed and lead them to the Lord.
		
				



- Church

		1. Praise: Annual Meeting Joint Worship Service: Praise the Lord that our two congregations had an uplifting joint service on Sunday and all voting items were smoothly passed in the annual meeting. 

		2. Governing Board Meeting: This Saturday Morning: Pray for the board meeting at 9:30 – 11:00 am at church this Saturday, 5/2. All current and new board members will attend this meeting. Major issues normally discussed in the May meeting are: 1) Welcoming new board members and elect new chairperson; 2) major changes and challenges in the next 12 months. Let us take this opportunity to pray for all the deacons, elders, pastors and their families. Pray for their personal relationship with God and with their family members, their growth in Christ, their ministries, and their studies or works. Pray especially for new board member who now assume new responsibilities: Mancang Dong (FF-Canaan) as Elder, Jianhua Chen(CCCF) as Elder, Jocelyn Bibert as English Ministry Deacon;  Victor Chen As Youth Ministry Deacon,  and Dae Guang Chung Kim as Board Secretary Deacon.
		
		3. All Church ministries online: Continue to pray that Pastor Paul and Pastor Tang will learn to effectively preach online.  Pray that many people will use their extra time to participate in our online prayer meetings, Bible studies and fellowship meetings.  Pray for unchurched people to invite to participate in these online ministries.  
		
		4. Registration for Seminary Extension online Class on Bible Ethics: This year  Dr Peter Chow, the former president of CES, will teach the online class on Bible Ethics from June 6 to June 10  It’s a great opportunity to learn from an experienced teacher and gain great insights on Christian life  that most people find it difficult to study by self. Pray that many church members will decide to take the class and register early.
		
		5. Brother Yeou-Cherng Bor’s Speaking in CCCF and Basil this Friday: Brother Yeou-Cherng Bor, the director of AFC and alumni of our church, will  give a special message on  coronavirus pandemic in  CCCF and Basil joint meeting  on Friday night.  Let us invite our friends to come. Please pray for his sermon preparation.
		
		6. Worship Service: Pray for the combined worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
		a. Speaker: Rev. Bin Tang will preach in the Combined Worship service on “Seek Holiness Through the Holy Sprite” from 1 Thessalonians 4: 1-12.  Pastor Paul will preach in English congregation. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it. 
		b. Communion Service: communion will be served in both online worship services.  Pray for Pastor Tang and Pastor Paul that they will be able to officiate the services in a way that draws people to worship Christ for His great sacrifice.  Pray that members will obtain the bread and the grape juice or wine ahead of time, so that they will be able to participate in the service.
