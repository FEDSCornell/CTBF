## Prayer
	
- Missions/World
		
		1) Pray for Siu-Yuk as she ministers to the handicapped in East Asia: Siu-Yuk has been helping to run a center to support the handicapped in a country in East Asia for the past ten years and is supported by our church. Her organization was recently allowed to do work in all the main districts of the city in which she is based. Pray that God would bless her work with handicapped in this city and that it would open natural doors for sharing the gospel and encouraging those who are already Christians. 
		 
		2) Pray for Lu Tsun-En in his ministry to Chinese students and theological study: Tsun-En works with Ambassadors for Christ, and is also studying for a Ph.D. in theology from Westminster Seminary. He has been leading a group of AFC coworkers in developing online ministry, and the current pandemic has caused their work to expand rapidly. Pray that God would bless Tsun-En and his team as they conduct online training and lead a large number of Chinese students in online morning devotions. Pray as well that God would help Tsun-En to find time to continue writing his dissertation, and that God would use this process to better equip him for ministry.
		
		3) Reopening after the lockdown:  Pray for wisdom for government leaders in deciding when to allow citizens to return to their work and other activities.  Pray that their decisions will result in the economy being restored as soon as possible while a minimum number of people getting sick.  Pray that citizens will be wise in their practices to help minimize health problems.  Pray also for wisdom for our church leaders as they consider different factors to decide when to reopen our church's worship services and other ministries.  Pray that they will set up procedures so that people can worship and fellowship with each other while keeping physically safe. Pray that people within our church will not waste the opportunities associated with the lockdown.  Pray that they will use this time to draw closer as a family and to work on their spiritual disciplines of reading the Bible and praying.
		
				
						



- Church

		1. All Church ministries online: Continue to pray that Pastor Paul and Pastor Tang will learn to effectively preach online.  Pray that many people will use their extra time to participate in our online prayer meetings, Bible studies and fellowship meetings.  Pray for unchurched people to invite to participate in these online ministries. 
		
		2. English Congregation: I. Abi Bernard graduated from Cornell University in December.  In the spring semester, our church has supported her as she served as a Cru intern.  During her time at Cornell and as a Cru intern, she has faithfully served our church as a shepherd/discipler and a worship team leader.  In late August/early September she plans to serve as a Cru intern in the Ivory Coast in which she will partner with the international church as well as participate in French-speaking ministry on college campuses.  Pray that the pandemic will not prevent her from serving the Lord in this way.  Pray that the Lord will raise up people to support her ministry financially and prayerfully.   II: Stephanie Deng is a Cornell student who faithfully serves as a youth worker in our church.  She is also currently volunteering with a group called TeleHealth Access for Seniors in which she is recruiting people to donate electronic devices or donations for electronic devices so that senior citizens can be in touch with their physicians during the pandemic.  Pray that she will be able to raise the needed donations and that it will result in senior citizens receiving the help they need. III:  Elise Epp is Pastor Paul and Hildy's daughter.  She has served faithfully as a youth worker in our church.  She  hopes and plans to go on a summer mission trip with Leaders Trek youth ministry in which she will train youth to work with the needy in the USA.  Pray that the leaders of Leaders Trek will have wisdom in deciding how and whether to proceed during the transition from lockdown to reopening.  Pray that the Lord will raise up people to support her ministry financially and prayerfully.  IV: During the COVID-19 crisis, many individuals and groups are asking for financial support to worthy causes, and yet many Christians are struggling financially because of unemployment, salary freezes or other reasons so they have limited resources.  Pray that people in our church will continue to give generously to our church.  Pray that they will have wisdom to decide whether to give to any of these other worthwhile causes.  If you are interested in supporting the ministries of Abi, Stephanie or Elise, please contact Pastor Paul Epp at ple25@cornell.edu.
		
		3. Registration for Seminary Extension online Class on Bible Ethics: This year  Dr Peter Chow, the former president of CES, will teach the online class on Bible Ethics from June 6 to June 10  It’s a great opportunity to learn from an experienced teacher and gain great insights on Christian life  that most people find it difficult to study by self. Pray that many church members will decide to take the class and register early.
		
		4. Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.

		a. Speaker: Rev. Bin Tang will preach in the Chinese Worship service on “Be Strong and Courageous"  from Joshua 1:1-9.   Pastor Paul will preach in English congregation. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it. 



- Individuals
	
		1. Pray for all the students who are graduating this year: Pray for their smooth transition, adjustment to the new environments, and their spiritual growth. May God provide all of them good spiritual homes when they move to new places. Also pray for those who are waiting for God’s guidance in future direction.
		
		2. Pray for Everyone Preparing for Ithaca Reopening: Ithaca enters in the phase 1 reopening, pray for every brother and sister’s psychological preparations for daily life, work and worship in the church building and the normalization of fellowship. 
		
		3. People Working on Their Doctoral Dissertation: A few brothers and sisters are working hard to finish their doctoral dissertations in these few months. Let us pray and ask God to give them wisdom, strength, patience, endurance, peace and joy.
