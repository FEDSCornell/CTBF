	## Prayer
	
	- Missions/World
		
		1) Pray for Zhang Tao and Yingyun as their third child is due this week: Zhang Tao is in his last semester of study at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and he and his wife Yingyun are expecting their third child this week (March 22 was the official due date). Pray for God’s gracious protection over the whole delivery process in the midst of the corona virus crisis. Praise God for the offers of support from brothers and sisters once the baby is born. Let’s also pray for special grace for Zhang Tao as he finishes up his last three courses, teaches two Sunday school classes, and supports Yingyun.
		
		 2) Pray for God’s protection from COVID19 and pollution for Derrick and Esther: Thailand has now been hit by the effects of the corona virus. Pray for God to protect the whole Tan family, and Derrick in particular, who has asthma and is at higher risk from the virus. Let’s also ask the Lord to make them effective messengers of the gospel at this anxious time. Lastly, pray for God by His mercy to raise up responsible officials who are motivated to deal with North Thailand’s very serious pollution problem, which is among the worst in the world (recently the governor of the province Derrick is in said there is no pollution problem in Thailand!) 
		
		3) Pray for David and Susan as they face the corona virus along with their students: A number of Chinese students who David and Susan have been training for cross-cultural missions returned to China recently, but 12 others will be staying with them because flights back home have been blocked. Pray that God will keep them safe from infection and will bless the time they have together in the city where they are, which is currently under lockdown.
	
	
		4) Coronavirus Pandemic:  We are going through uncharted waters as we respond to the coronavirus crisis.  Leaders in the government, educational, medical, business and churches do not have the experience or expertise to know how to respond to the various issues related to this crisis.  But we can have peace that in the midst of these troubled waters, that Christ is the Captain of our ship (particularly our fellowship).  And the Bible promises that when we go through trials like this, that if we ask God for wisdom, He will give it to us generously (see James 1:2-8).  So let's pray that government, education, medical, business and church leaders  will humble themselves and seek God's wisdom to address medical and financial crises.  Pray that as a result revival will break out in our country and all over the world - particularly in the countries where the crisis is most severe .



- Church

	1. Students in the Coronavirus crisis:  Pray for students who face the difficulties of 1. Fellowship Groups’ Leadership Transition: Continue to pray for God’s guidance upon those who are approached to fill some deacon positions when the current term ends in late April. Also continue to pray for some fellowship groups that are considering leadership change or adjustment for the next school year.  

	2. All Church ministries online: Continue to  pray that Pastor Paul and Pastor Tang will learn to effectively preach online.  Pray that many people will use their extra time to participate in our online prayer meetings, Bible studies and fellowship meetings.  Pray for unchurched people to invite to participate in these online ministries.  
	
	3. Planning for The Fasting & Prayer Retreat: Please continue pray for the planning of the fasting & prayer retreat on 4/5 online.
	
	4. Elders and Deacons Nomination: Continue to pray for God’s guidance upon those who are approached to fill some elder and deacon positions when the current term ends in late April.
	
	5. Worship Service: Pray for the two worship services this coming Sunday by online.  Let us worship with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
	a. Speaker: Minister Daode Chen from MBCSFV,CA.will preach on “The good countermarching Shepherd” from John 10:11-30  in Chinese  Service and Pastor Paul will preach in English service.  Please pray for their sermons preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it. 

	

- Individuals
	
	1. Good Balance in Stressful Situation: Many people in our church have to deal with stress frequently.  While we pray for God’s strength and grace upon them, let us also pray for wisdom and maturity to learn to keep good balance in life, especially in the areas of setting priorities and time management.
	
	2. College Admission: Many colleges will send admission notice around this Friday.  Pray for the high school seniors in our church who are waiting for the results. May God give them clear guidance when they have multiple choices. Let us also begin to pray for the kids who will come to study at Cornell and Ithaca College this Fall. Pray that God will bring many Christians to our church and work together with us to strengthen more fellowships, e.g. Basil, CCCF,CTBF and family fellowships; and that God will also bring many seekers to our church to hear the Gospel and come to know the grace of God.
