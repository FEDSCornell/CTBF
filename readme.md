## Prayer

### Missions/World 
1) Pray for Derrick and Esther as they wait to return to Thailand: Derrick and Esther have been back in the US since March, due to the pandemic. They are eager to get back to their ministry in Thailand, but so for the government there is not allowing them to return, and now democracy protests have begun, which could complicate things further. Let’s pray for God to open the door for Derrick and Esther to return, and to help them while they wait to put the extra time here in the States to good use.

2) Pray for Lu Tsun-En as he works on his Ph.D. dissertation in New Testament theology: Tsun-En works full-time with Ambassadors for Christ while completing his Ph.D. dissertation on the parables of Jesus. He is now more than halfway through the project. Pray for God to give Tsun-En strength, wisdom, and discipline to finish the dissertation while balancing ministry and family needs.



### Church                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
1. Mandarin Evangelistic Meetings:  The long awaited Mandarin EM is coming this weekend. (10/23-25).  The main theme will be “The Pursuit”. Let us pray fervently for the following:
a. Pray for the powerful work of the Holy Spirit upon all of the evangelistic meeting sessions this weekend and in the heart of each and every seeker.
• Friday 7:30 – 9:30 PM (Session 1): 生命的追尋 from 1 John 5:12; John 5:24;
• Saturday 7:30 – 9:300 PM (Session 2): 美麗心靈 from Jeremianh 17:9; Romans 5:6-8;
• Sunday 11:15 AM (Session 3): 一個無知的精明人  from Luke 12:13-21
b. Pray for God’s guidance and anointing upon everyone who serves, including the speaker— Prof. Der-Chen Chang, the worship leaders, ushers, prayer intercessors, etc.
c. Pray that every one of us will make at least one personal invitation to specific non-Christian friends and bring them to church to hear the gospel message.
d. Pray that all Christians will be spiritually ready to come to the meetings early (or on time) and pray in heart throughout each meeting session:
e. Pray for the Intercessory prayer during each session of the Mandarin EM. May God give many brothers and sisters the burden to join the Intercessory Prayer.

2. Growth and Fruit-bearing of Every Christian:  While we are holding evangelistic meetings with the hope of leading more people into the Body of Christ, let us also pray that Christians in our church (especially those who got baptized here) bear good testimony for Christ, and other can really see from our lives that we are committed followers of Christ. Pray that no Christian in our church will stay spiritually immature for years, turn lukewarm and become salt that lost its saltiness. Let us heed the warning in Hebrews 10:25 “Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching.”

3. Youth Parents Meeting: Youth workers and the parents will have an online meeting at 4:30 to 5:30 PM the coming Sunday afternoon. Pray for good communication among them, and for the guidance of the Holy Spirit upon all participants for all the issues that are to be discussed and all the decisions that will be made.

4. Worship Service: Pray for the two worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
a. Speaker:  Prof. Der-Chen Chang will preach in the Chinese worship service on “An Unenlightened Shrewd Man” from Luke 12:13-21.   Pastor Paul will preach in the English worship. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it.
b. The people Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.


### Individuals
1. People Looking for Job: Pray for our brothers and sisters who are looking for jobs. Some will have job interview very soon.  Pray for God’s guidance upon each one of them.

2. Good Balance in Stressful Situation: Many people ( specially the new students) in our church have to deal with stress frequently.  While we pray for God’s strength and grace upon them, let us also pray for wisdom and maturity to learn to keep good balance in life, especially in the areas of setting priorities and time management.

3. Students Who Are Struggling with Schoolwork: In this very competitive environment many students are struggling with schoolwork. Let us take initiative to reach out and care for them with words of encouragement and prayer.  The ones who need caring the most are very likely those who have not been coming to fellowship and/or Sunday worship as often recently.
