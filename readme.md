## Prayer

- Missions/World
		
		1) Pray for Abi Bernard as she prepares for a year-long mission in Africa:  Abi Bernard has been a faithful member of our English congregation for the past several years, first as an undergraduate student at Cornell (she graduated in December 2019) and these past six months as a full-time intern with Cru at Cornell. She is now preparing to serve with Cru for a year in the nation of Ivory Coast in Western Africa, where she will be reaching out to students. Pray that God guides her steps, as the current pandemic has created much uncertainty, and abundantly provides for all of her financial needs should He open the door for her to go, as seems likely. Let’s also ask the Lord to make Abi a channel of His saving grace to many needy souls in that country.
		
		2) Pray for Brother Li Yue as he prepares for full-time ministry: Li Yue was part of FICCC during his time at Cornell from 2005 to 2008 and feels a strong sense of calling to minister to Chinese students. FICCC started supporting his online theological study via Gordon-Conwell in January this year. Yue is currently seeking God’s guidance about when to shift to full-time study (he is leaning towards Fall 2021). Let’s pray for God to give him clear direction as he makes this decision, and to bless his preparation for ministry.
		
		3)  Pray  for Local school reopening: Pray for the local school districts as they are preparing the school to resume class in fall. They have to take into many considerations to safeguard all students. May God grant them wisdom. In addition, we also pray for all the international students in Cornell. IC and TC3 who may be affected by the Fall guidance. Grant them peace and guide their paths.
						
		

- Church

			1.	Our Spiritual Readiness: Every year, from mid-August to late October is always the busiest time for our church, and especially for the coworkers. As we will enter into the month of August, let us pray for our spiritual readiness.  Pray that every coworker will stay close to God and maintain good discipline in daily life, and that we pursue strong unity by standing together and supporting one another.

			2.	Family Fellowship Groups: While the student fellowship groups like CCCF Basil and CTBF are getting ready to reach out to incoming new students,  the family fellowship groups – FF-Canaan, and FF-University Heights are also hoping to grow stronger and more effective in attracting new comers who have families.  Let us pray and cheer for them.
			
			3.	Worship Service: Pray for the worship services this coming Sunday.  Let us come with a joyful heart and lift up our voices to glorify God.
			a.	Speaker:  Rev. Bin Tang from Corning will preach in the Chinese Worship service on “Experiencing Revival While Waiting” from Isaiah 40：27-31. Stephan Teng will preach in English congregation. Please pray for their sermon preparations. Let us also pray for our readiness to hear God’s Word and to respond to it.
			b.	Communion: Pray for our readiness to take the communion.
			c.	The people Who Serve: Pray for everyone who will be serving in the worship service.

Mrs. Wong Passed away on last Tuesday: It's with sadness that we remember that Mrs. Wong – Shet-Fai Chan , wife of  former Pastor David Wong passed away in the morning of July 21st  at the age of 96..  We have the confidence that Mrs Wong is in the presence of Jesus and joined with Pastor David Wong in heaven that we will see them again someday.  Dur to the pandemic, there are not the graveside service and memorial service in this time. She has buried at East lawn Cemetery on this Monday morning (7/27) .  Pray that God would comfort and strengthen the family as they will continue to grieve.
